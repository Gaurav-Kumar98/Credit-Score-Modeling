# Credit-Score-Modeling

The likelihood that a borrower would not repay their loan to the lender is known as Credit Risk. It is measured in probability, i.e. a value from 0 - 1 but to make it easy to understand for everyone, the probability is converted into a score known as Credit Score.  
Higher the probability of not repaying the loan (default event), lower will be the Score and vice-versa.  
Minimum score is 300 and maximum score is 850 as adopted by FICO.
